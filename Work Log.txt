```
* Variables hold reusable data in a program.
* JavaScript will throw an error if you try to reassign const variables.
* You can reassign variables that you create with the let keyword.
* Unset variables store the primitive data type undefined.
Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
* The + operator is used to interpolate (combine) multiple strings.
In JavaScript ES6, backticks (`) and ${} are used to interpolate values into a string.
