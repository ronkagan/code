//review_of_functions
/*
This unit introduced you to functions.

Functions are written to perform a task.
Functions take data, perform a set of tasks on the data, and then return the result.
We can define parameters to be used when calling the function.
When calling a function, we can pass in arguments, which will set the function's parameters.
We can use return to return the result of a function which allows us to call functions anywhere, even inside other functions.

1.
 Correct syntax for a function expression... the following is a correct use of the arrow function expression:

	const myFunction = () => {

	};

2.
 A function declaration uses the function keyword, a name, and a function body.
	let side = 5;

	function volumeOfCube () {
	  return side * side * side;
	}

	volumeOfCube();
	// Output: 125.

3.
The purpose of parameters is to capture the value of arguments passed to functions.
